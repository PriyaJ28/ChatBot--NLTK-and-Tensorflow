# ChatBot--NLTK-and-Tensorflow

A chatbot is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. 

This project aims on building a retrieval-based chatbot that uses a predefined input patterns and responses. It then uses some type of heuristic approach to select the appropriate response.
